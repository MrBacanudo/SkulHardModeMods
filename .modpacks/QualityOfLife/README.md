# MrBacanudo's Quality of Life ModPack

This modpack focuses on mods that do not change gameplay or your skull power.
The idea is to keep the gameplay and the sandboxed experience very limited to things you could normally get by resetting at the castle.

If you want the full modded experience, download [The Sandbox Modpack](https://thunderstore.io/c/skul-the-hero-slayer/p/MrBacanudo/HardMode_Sandbox_ModPack/).

Mods included:

1. [Fix NPC RNG](https://thunderstore.io/c/skul-the-hero-slayer/p/MrBacanudo/FixNPCs/)
    - You can now get damage amplification from the Spokesman of the Mist (virtually impossible on the main game)
    - Slime can duplicate any item! (for 9 items, it's skewed for 2, 5 and 9 positions instead)
2. [Start with random picks, if you want](https://thunderstore.io/c/skul-the-hero-slayer/p/MrBacanudo/RandomStart/)
    - Some players might want the starting variety from normal mode, and this mod allows to do so in Hard Mode as well.
3. [Start with any skills you want](https://thunderstore.io/c/skul-the-hero-slayer/p/MrBacanudo/RerollsOnCastle/)
    - Restarting the game to get a specific skill is unnecessary. Use a machine to just reroll them instead.
